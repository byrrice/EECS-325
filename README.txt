README FOR P1
Author: Isaac Ng

a) I am student 5030, so I used a default port of 5030.
b) Compile it by using javac proxyd.java in the “home_directory/project1/src” directory 
   and then executing the command “java proxyd –port 5030". Then, visit various websites and 
   watch my proxy spit out errors and try to load various images/text.
c) I used Google Chrome to test this.
   For future reference (Windows 10):
    1. Chrome, Settings, Advanced, Proxy
    2. Command Window, type in ipconfig
    3. Set port to desired port number (5030)
    4. Lan Settings: ipconfig is ipv4 address (wifi), port: 5030/desired port
d) Tested on teamfortress.tv, 4chan.org, cnn.com, case.edu, cluster41.case.edu
e) I get errors like Unknown Host Exception which is due to the hostName sometimes 
   being wrong. It still loads the requisite websites though.
